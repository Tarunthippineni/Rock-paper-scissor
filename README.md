# Rock-paper-scissor
 Teachable Machine to recognize Rock-Paper-Scissors hand gestures and explore best practices for creating informative GitHub repository documentation.

Training Teachable Machine for Rock-Paper-Scissors:

Launch into Teachable Machine: Open your web browser and navigate to Teachable Machine's website at https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/.

Model Selection: Since we'll be using images for training, choose the "Image" model type. This option is ideal for classifying static objects based on visual data.

Class Creation: Click on "Add Class" three times to establish distinct categories for Rock, Paper, and Scissors. Utilize the pencil icon beside each class name to rename them accordingly.

Data Gathering:  This stage significantly impacts the model's accuracy. Here's how to collect impactful training data:

Image Capture: Employ your webcam or import existing images. Capture clear and well-lit photographs of your hand forming each gesture (Rock, Paper, Scissors) from various angles and lighting conditions. Aim to collect at least 20-30 images per class to ensure a comprehensive dataset.

Distinct Hand Postures: Strive for clear differentiation between the hand formations for each gesture. A closed fist signifies Rock, an open palm represents Paper, and two extended fingers form Scissors.

Model Training: Once you've amassed a sufficient number of images in each class, click on "Train Model" to initiate the training process. This might take a few minutes depending on the volume of your data.

Enhancing Training Efficacy:

Data Balance:  It's crucial to have a roughly equal number of images for each class (Rock, Paper, Scissors). This prevents the model from biasing its recognition towards a class with more data.

Variations are Key: Capture images with diverse backgrounds, lighting scenarios, and slightly different hand positions. This broadens the model's ability to recognize gestures even with slight variations in real-world use.

Test and Iterate: After training, assess the model's performance using a set of new images. If the accuracy isn't ideal, gather more data, focusing on the classes where the model struggles. By incorporating these refinements, you can significantly improve the model's ability to distinguish between Rock, Paper, and Scissors gestures.

Crafting Stellar GitHub Repository Documentation (Optional):

If you plan to share your project or code on GitHub, creating thorough documentation enhances understanding for others who might want to explore or utilize your work. Here are some key elements to incorporate:

Project Overview: Provide a concise explanation of your project's objective (Rock-Paper-Scissors hand gesture recognition with Teachable Machine).

Step-by-Step Guide: Outline a clear and comprehensive breakdown of the steps mentioned above for training the Teachable Machine model. Include details like image capture recommendations and how to navigate Teachable Machine's interface for optimal clarity.

Code Inclusion (if applicable): If you're integrating the model with code for playing Rock-Paper-Scissors, include the code along with comments that elucidate its functionality. This allows others to understand how the model interacts with the game logic.

Resource Links:  Mention resources like Teachable Machine's website for users who want to delve deeper into image recognition and its capabilities.
